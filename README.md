# dtcpdfgen
A tool to generate a PDF file to use with drivethrucards.



## Roadmap

- [x] fix page sizing: inputs are for total page size, including bleeding area
- [x] fix large number of images not working: likely compression issues
- [ ] offer choice of inch/mm measurements
- [x] offer presets of drivethrucards
- [x] offer image and pdf compression choice
- [x] look into generating pdf with the right profile
- [ ] extend the image upload / cards display: sortable list of cards, with front and back
  - [ ] common back update option
  - [ ] number of copies per card option (default 1)
  - [ ] auto populating
- [x] some nice styling. nothing too fancy
- [ ] possibly connect to mpcfill or similar to enable list import, not just image import
