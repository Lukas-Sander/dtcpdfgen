# dtcpdfgen
A tool to generate a PDF file to use with drivethrucards.



## Roadmap

- [ ] fix page sizing: inputs are for total page size, including bleeding area
- [ ] fix large number of images not working: likely compression issues
- [ ] offer choice of inch/mm measurements
- [ ] offer presets of drivethrucards
- [ ] offer image and pdf compression choice
- [ ] look into generating pdf with the right profile
- [ ] extend the image upload / cards display: sortable list of cards, with front and back
  - [ ] common back update option
  - [ ] number of copies per card option (default 1)
  - [ ] auto populating
- [ ] some nice styling. nothing too fancy
- [ ] possibly connect to mpcfill or similar to enable list import, not just image import
